Civil twilight seems to show much lower speeds in the presence of high precipitation events than
night time events.

This could possibly be due to traffic volumes but there is no way to verify this with the current data set available.

Civil twilight hours were determined from: https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/usa/sunrise?month=6&year=2018

When split out by day of week, something very interesting occurs. Monday has very little precipitation.

Wednesday, Thursday, Friday show the most low speed events in the presence of precipitation.
