Note: This data set was provided to personnel of Indiana Geological and Water Survey (IGS) on October 8, 2004 by Indiana
Department of Natural Resources personnel. An updated data set was received on May 7, 2012, June 15, 2012, March 26, 2013,
February 10, 2014, May 19, 2015, June 16, 2016, April 20, 2017, August 16, 2018, and January 22, 2019.

At the request of IDNR personnel, this metadata and associated GIS layer were renamed to &quot;Floodplains_FIRM_IDNR_IN&quot; on
June 15, 2012 and the naming convention has been carried forward for all subsequent updates.

Please visit the following IDNR Web sites and other online resources for more information about floodplains in Indiana:

1. Indiana Floodplain Mapping - https://www.in.gov/dnr/water/5647.htm

Web site outlining the Engineering Service Center of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Water, which provides engineering and technical support in support of Floodplain
Management in Indiana. Contains more &quot;Indiana Floodplain Mapping Quick Links.&quot;

2. Indiana Floodplain Information Portal (INFIP) - https://dnrmaps.dnr.in.gov/appsphp/fdms/

INFIP is a mapping application that provides floodplain information for waterways to help citizens
determine flood risk in an effort to minimized flood damage. Users can search for locations by
address, search county-based flood insurance studies, or use the eFARA Wizard to request
formal Floodplain Analysis and Regulatory Assessments (FARA). Each FARA provides floodplain
information and the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) for a specific point of interest.

3. Indiana DNR Zone A Floodplain Mapping Project - https://indnr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=48665e0948b04b398fbc07b8ea1cf232

An IDNR ArcGIS Online Story Map that provides information about the mapping project, and the role
the IDNR, Division of Water fulfills in producing detailed, model-backed floodplain information
for every major river in Indiana for Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), published by FEMA. The
INFIP application is also embedded in this story map.

4. General Guidelines for the Hydrologic-Hydraulic Assessment of Floodplains in Indiana -  https://www.in.gov/dnr/water/5710.htm

Guidelines created to assist the floodplain management community in establishing base flood
elevations and floodway limits and in evaluating projects in accordance with the Indiana Flood
Control Act and the National Flood Insurance Program. The guidelines detail methods acceptable
to both the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) and the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) with respect to hydrologic and hydraulic modeling and floodplain mapping. Also
included in this guide are recommendations on presenting results of a floodplain study and other
useful reference material.

5. Floodplain Management &amp; Homeowner Information - https://www.in.gov/dnr/water/5084.htm

Web site containing numerous links to online resources for community officials and homeowners.

6. FEMA Flood Map Service Center - https://msc.fema.gov/portal/home

The FEMA Flood Map Service Center (MSC) is the official public source for flood hazard
information produced in support of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Use the
MSC to find your official flood map, access a range of other flood hazard products, and
take advantage of tools for better understanding flood risk.

IDNR documentation states -

“This database is an interim version of the Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database.  It does
not fully meet all DFIRM specifications as found in “Guidelines and Specifications for Flood Hazard Mapping
Partners, Appendix L: Guidance for Preparing Draft Digital Data and DFIRM Database. The DFIRM depicts flood
risk information and supporting data used to develop the risk data. For flood insurance rating purposes,
flood insurance zone designations are assigned to a community based on the results of the engineering analyses.”

&quot;The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where
available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The
specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping
at a scale of 1:12,000. Last updated 12/14/18.&quot;
</abstract>
<purpose>
IDNR documentation states –

&quot;The purpose of this interim product is to provide much of the same information as the paper FIRM while
moving toward compliance with the specifications found in &quot;Guidelines and Specifications for Flood Hazard
Mapping Partners, Appendix L: Guidance for Preparing Draft Digital Data and DFIRM Database&quot;. The FIRM is
the basis for floodplain management, mitigation, and insurance activities for the National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP). Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the
Flood Disaster Protection Act, which &quot;... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who
are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or
institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified
areas having special flood hazards,&quot; Section 2(b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. In
addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs
are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP. The
DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for
use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital FIS database that
serves to archive the information collected during the FIS.”

“This database is an interim version of the Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database. It does not fully meet all DFIRM
specifications as found in “Guidelines and Specifications for Flood Hazard Mapping Partners, Appendix L: Guidance for Preparing
Draft Digital Data and DFIRM Database”.

&quot;The hardcopy FIRM and DFIRM and the accompanying FISs are the official designation of SFHAs and Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) for
the NFIP. For the purposes of the NFIP, changes to the flood risk information published by FEMA may only be performed by FEMA and
through the mechanisms established in the NFIP regulations (44 CFR Parts 59-78). These digital data are produced in conjunction
with the hardcopy FIRMs and generally match the hardcopy map exactly. However the hardcopy flood maps and flood profiles are the
authoritative documents for the NFIP.”

Empty fields are present within the data table but have been left intact in anticipation of updates as this digital data is improved
to FEMA DFIRM standards.

IDNR documentation states –

“The DFIRM Database consists of countywide vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hard
copy FEMAFIRM. The published effective FIRM and DFIRM maps are issued as the official designation of the SFHAs. As such
they are adopted by local communities nd form the basis for administration of the NFIP. For these purposes they are
authoritative. Provisions exist in the regulations for public review, appeals and corrections of the flood risk information
shown to better match real world conditions. As with any engineering analysis of this type, variation from the estimated
flood heights and floodplain boundaries is possible. Details of FEMA&apos;s requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process
that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Specifications for Flood Hazard Mapping Partners. Attribute accuracy
was tested by manual comparison of source graphics with hardcopy plots and a symbolized display on an interactive computer
graphic system. Independent quality control testing of FEMA’s DFIRM database was also performed.”

To obtain more detailed information in areas where Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) and/or floodways have been determined, users are
encouraged to consult the Flood Profiles and Floodway Data and/or Summary of Stillwater Elevations tables contained within the FIS
report that accompanies this DFIRM database. Flood elevation data presented in the FIS report must be used in conjunction with the
FIRM for purposes of construction and/or floodplain management.”
</attraccr>
</attracc>
<logic>
IDNR documentation states –

“When FEMA revises an FIS, adjacent studies are checked to ensure agreement between flood elevations at the boundaries. Likewise flood
elevations at the confluence of streams studied independently are checked to ensure agreement at the confluence. The FIRM and the FIS
are developed together and care is taken to ensure that the elevations and other features shown on the flood profiles in the FIS agree
with the information shown on the FIRM. However, the elevations as shown on the FIRM are rounded whole-foot elevations. They must be shown
so that a profile recreated from the elevations on the FIRM will match the FIS profiles within one half of one foot.”
</logic>
<complete>
IDNR documentation states –

“Data contained in the DFIRM Database files reflect the content of the source materials. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on
the source graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints. With new mapping, FEMA plans to maintain full detail in the spatial data it produces.
However, older information is often transferred from existing maps where some generalization has taken place. Flood risk data are developed for
communities participating in the NFIP for use in insurance rating and for floodplain management. Flood hazard areas are determined using statistical
analyses of records of river flow, storm tides, and rainfall; information obtained through consultation with the communities; floodplain topographic
surveys; and hydrological and hydraulic analysis. Both detailed and approximate analyses are employed. Generally, detailed analyses are used
to generate flood risk data only for developed or developing areas of communities. For areas where little or no development is expected to
occur, FEMA uses approximate analyses to generate flood risk data. Typically, only drainage areas that are greater than one square mile are
studied.”
