  Description:
    Abstract:
      This polygon layer represents floodplains created from FEMA Flood Rate Insurance Maps (FIRM). The layer is symbolized to show the
      following flood hazard primary risk classifications using the "Unique Values, Many Fields" option, using the attribute fields
      named "FLD_ZONE" and "ZONE_SUBTY":

      Flood Hazard Primary Risk Classification								FLD_ZONE/ZONE_SUBTY field values

      ------------------------------------------------------------			---------------------------------------------------

      "Floodways" 															- (AE/FLOODWAY)

      "1 % Annual Chance Flood Hazard" (aka 100-year flood zone) 			- (A/'null', AE/'null', AH/'null', and AO/'null')

      "0.2 % Annual Chance Flood Hazard" (aka 500-year Flood Zone) 			- (X/0.2 PCT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD HAZARD)

      "0.2 % Annual Chance, Protected by Levee" 							- (X/AREA WITH REDUCED FLOOD RISK DUE TO LEVEE)

      IDNR documentation states -

      “This database is an interim version of the Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database.  It does
      not fully meet all DFIRM specifications as found in “Guidelines and Specifications for Flood Hazard Mapping
      Partners, Appendix L: Guidance for Preparing Draft Digital Data and DFIRM Database. The DFIRM depicts flood
      risk information and supporting data used to develop the risk data. For flood insurance rating purposes,
      flood insurance zone designations are assigned to a community based on the results of the engineering analyses.”

      "The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate
      Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where
      available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The
      specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping
      at a scale of 1:12,000. Last updated 12/14/18."
    Purpose:
      IDNR documentation states –

      "The purpose of this interim product is to provide much of the same information as the paper FIRM while
      moving toward compliance with the specifications found in "Guidelines and Specifications for Flood Hazard
      Mapping Partners, Appendix L: Guidance for Preparing Draft Digital Data and DFIRM Database". The FIRM is
      the basis for floodplain management, mitigation, and insurance activities for the National Flood Insurance
      Program (NFIP). Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the
      Flood Disaster Protection Act, which "... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who
      are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or
      institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified
      areas having special flood hazards," Section 2(b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. In
      addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs
      are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP. The
      DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for
      use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital FIS database that
      serves to archive the information collected during the FIS.”

    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Empty fields are present within the data table but have been left intact in anticipation of updates as this digital data is improved
      to FEMA DFIRM standards.

      IDNR documentation states –

      “The DFIRM Database consists of countywide vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hard
      copy FEMAFIRM. The published effective FIRM and DFIRM maps are issued as the official designation of the SFHAs. As such
      they are adopted by local communities nd form the basis for administration of the NFIP. For these purposes they are
      authoritative. Provisions exist in the regulations for public review, appeals and corrections of the flood risk information
      shown to better match real world conditions. As with any engineering analysis of this type, variation from the estimated
      flood heights and floodplain boundaries is possible. Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process
      that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Specifications for Flood Hazard Mapping Partners. Attribute accuracy
      was tested by manual comparison of source graphics with hardcopy plots and a symbolized display on an interactive computer
      graphic system. Independent quality control testing of FEMA’s DFIRM database was also performed.”

      To obtain more detailed information in areas where Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) and/or floodways have been determined, users are
      encouraged to consult the Flood Profiles and Floodway Data and/or Summary of Stillwater Elevations tables contained within the FIS
      report that accompanies this DFIRM database. Flood elevation data presented in the FIS report must be used in conjunction with the
      FIRM for purposes of construction and/or floodplain management.”

  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    IDNR documentation states –

    “When FEMA revises an FIS, adjacent studies are checked to ensure agreement between flood elevations at the boundaries. Likewise flood
    elevations at the confluence of streams studied independently are checked to ensure agreement at the confluence. The FIRM and the FIS
    are developed together and care is taken to ensure that the elevations and other features shown on the flood profiles in the FIS agree
    with the information shown on the FIRM. However, the elevations as shown on the FIRM are rounded whole-foot elevations. They must be shown
    so that a profile recreated from the elevations on the FIRM will match the FIS profiles within one half of one foot.”

  Completeness_Report:
    IDNR documentation states –

    “Data contained in the DFIRM Database files reflect the content of the source materials. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on
    the source graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints. With new mapping, FEMA plans to maintain full detail in the spatial data it produces.
    However, older information is often transferred from existing maps where some generalization has taken place. Flood risk data are developed for
    communities participating in the NFIP for use in insurance rating and for floodplain management. Flood hazard areas are determined using statistical
    analyses of records of river flow, storm tides, and rainfall; information obtained through consultation with the communities; floodplain topographic
    surveys; and hydrological and hydraulic analysis. Both detailed and approximate analyses are employed. Generally, detailed analyses are used
    to generate flood risk data only for developed or developing areas of communities. For areas where little or no development is expected to
    occur, FEMA uses approximate analyses to generate flood risk data. Typically, only drainage areas that are greater than one square mile are
    studied.”
